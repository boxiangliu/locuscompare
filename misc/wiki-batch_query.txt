Title: Batch Query

# Overview

Batch query allows you to input a set of regions. Within each region, LocusCompare will plot all pairs of traits in study 1 and 2. 

# Usage 

1. Select a published study using the `Study Name` drop-down menu. 

2. You can also upload your own study by clicking the `Browse` button. You file should have three columns: `trait`, `rsid`, and `pval`. An example file can be downloaded via the `Example file` link above the `Browser` button. 

  _**Note: Either choose a published study or upload your own study, but not both.**_

3. Repeat **Steps 1-2** for study 2. 

4. Choose a reference population. EUR = European. EAS = East Asian, AFR = African, SAS = South Asian, AMR = Native American. 

5. Type in genomic regions. Each line should contain one region. The three formats below are valid. 
    * `gene name`:`flanking window size`. 
    * `SNP`:`flanking window size`.
    * `chr`:`start`-`end`

    _**Note: because of constraints in file size, a maximum of 25 regions are allowed. If you provide more than 25 regions, the first 25 will be used.**_

6. You can also upload a file of regions. Each line of the file should contain one region. Use the same format above to specify each region. 

7. Choose an informative job name. 

8. Enter a valid email. 

9. Select plot dimensions. 

10. Click `Submit`.

You will get an email shortly about the result.
