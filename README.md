# LocusCompare

## Introduction
LocusCompare is an interactive visualization tool for comparing two genetic association datasets. For instance, it can be used to visualize the colocalization between a GWAS dataset to an eQTL dataset, which is particularly useful for fine-mapping studies. 

## Usage
Please see the [FAQ page](https://github.com/boxiangliu/locuscompare/wiki/FAQ) and the [documentation page](https://github.com/boxiangliu/locuscompare/wiki)
