1) Upload GWAS_Blood_Cell_Traits_Astle_2016 to MYSQL
2) Upload GWAS_Circulating_Metabolites_Kettunen_2016 to MYSQL
3) Update the batch mode
The current selection is too flexible. 
It would make more sense to let the user select GWAS and eQTL datasets, and then select genes.
Also need to farm out processes to other servers, the webserver only has 2 cores, so even with 
async processes, the server will have to wait when N > 2 users are submiting batch queries.
